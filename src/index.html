        <h1>Bauknecht Dev</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm <span>Mike Bauknecht</span>, a software developer based in Watertown, Wisconsin.
            I started in front-end web development and continuously worked my way deeper into the stack.
            I've done a fair bit of cloud native development and that is where I prefer to spend my time.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this site you'll find my work history, technical descriptions about some professional projects and some of my personal projects.
            This site itself is my exploration into static site generation with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> and styling with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>.

        <h2>Career Eras</h2>
        <p>
            These notes have come from reflecting on my career, I wasn't always aware of them as they were happening.
            You will see that <span>vNext</span> has been left empty, I'm hoping that after this project I'll have some ideas.

            <summary>Scrappy Web Developer</summary>
            <p>
                My first web development job came from a bit of persistence and following up on a postion I wasn't qualified for.
                It turned out to be an amazing start and a great playground to try what I was learning in classes with real stakeholders.
                I loved being tasked with something and then figuring out how to make it work, never doubting there was a way.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the early parts of this era I was also working on a lot of personal projects. I was a huge fan of <a href="https://csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>,
                I took their idea of applying different style sheets to the same content to create myself a personal portal that I could swap the style sheet for different visuals.
                I liked creating designs based on movies and nature. I wish Github was around back then, I haven't been able to find those files on my old hard drives.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first professional software postion off campus brought me into the world of server-side programming and database access.
                I was also introduced to the world of team development, source control and code reviews. No more lone-wolf programming, you break it you have others to own up to.

                    <li>Taking feedback - I had some amazing senior developers. I was willing to listen to better ways of doing things and they respected my ideas too.</li>
                    <li>No task too small - I did a 6 month+ tour only doing hotfixes and triaging issues, man did I learn a ton about software development and our systems.</li>
